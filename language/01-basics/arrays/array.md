# Arrays

As Arrays are Objects and not primitives they also offer some methods to work
with them.
Very important methods are push(), to add a new item to an Array and
indexOf() to find the position of a value in an array.


From MDN:
> The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high-level, list-like objects.
