From wikipedia:
> ECMAScript is a programming language itself, specified in the document ECMA-262. In other words, ECMA-262 is the specification of the programming language ECMAScript.

> JavaScript, on the other hand, can be viewed as a "dialect" of ECMAScript. It conforms to the ECMAScript specification while also providing additional features not described in the specification.

**Javascript is a dialect derived from the ECMAScript scripting language specification.**
